        "1. **Accuracy for native English speakers: 0.60**\n",
        "    - This means the LLM correctly answered 60% of the questions posed by native English speakers.\n",
        "  \n",
        "2. **Accuracy for non-native English speakers: 0.20**\n",
        "    - The LLM correctly answered only 20% of the questions posed by non-native English speakers.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Interpretation**:\n",
        "\n",
        "- There's a significant disparity in the model's performance between the two groups. The model seems to perform better for native English speakers compared to non-native speakers by a wide margin (40% difference in accuracy).\n",
        "  \n",
        "- Such a disparity might suggest that the LLM is biased in favor of native English speakers or is not adept at understanding the nuances or potential grammatical inaccuracies in questions posed by non-native speakers.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Implications**:\n",
        "\n",
        "- If the LLM is being used in applications that cater to a global audience, this bias can be problematic. It's crucial to ensure equitable performance across diverse user groups.\n",
        "  \n",
        "- Further investigation is needed to determine the cause of this disparity. Is it because of the way questions are phrased by non-native speakers? Or is the model inherently biased due to its training data? Answering these questions can guide interventions to improve the model's performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Recommendations**:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Data Augmentation**: Introduce more diverse training data, especially data representing non-native English speakers.\n",
        "2. **Feedback Loop**: Allow users to provide feedback on incorrect answers, and use this feedback to continuously train and improve the model.\n",
        "3. **Bias Mitigation Techniques**: Apply techniques designed to reduce bias in AI models.\n",
        "4. **Clear Communication**: If deploying the model in its current state, communicate its limitations to users.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, the results indicate a need for further refinement and calibration of the LLM to ensure it serves all user groups equitably."
